# AdventOfCode 
Advent of code in kotlin by me

## How to run yourself
Every day gets the input and the example automatically (Example doesn't always get the codeblock)

### 1. Get session token
Create a `puzzleInputs/sessionToken.txt` with the session token you can get from your cookies once you are logged into AOC.

### 2. Run any day
Run any file with InteliJ or use the kotlin compiler
